# For sale game rules
## Aim of the game
A round of For Sale is played in two
phases. As a first step, players buy
auction houses to form a card hand.

In the second step, the players will
resell these houses for cheques.
The player who has the most money
at the end of the game is declared
winner.

## Setting up

- Separate the home cards from the
cheque cards. Mix the House cards
to form the house deck, and do the
same with the cheque cards to form
the cheque deck.
- If there is 3-4 players, remove from each deck random cards without looking: 3 players - 6 cards, 4 players - 2 cards.
- Each player receives: 3-4 players: 18
coins, 5-6 players: 14 coins.
You should keep your coins hidden.
- The first player is randomly
determined.

## Course of the game

A round of For Sale is divided into two
distinct phases. In the first phase,
players buy home cards through their
coins. In a second time, they sell
these cards for cheques.

## Phase 1: Buying houses

This phase consists of several bidding
rounds and ends when all the house
cards have been sold.

At the beginning of each round, draw
as many home cards as players and
place them face up in the center of
the table. The round ends when all
these houses were taken by the
players. The players play one after
the other in the clockwise direction
starting with the first player. In turn,
a player has two options:
**Bid** Or **Spend**.

### Bid 

To bid, a player must place in front of
him, visible to all, a certain number of
pieces. The first player to bid can make
an auction of the value of his choice.
The following players must bid higher
than the last one announced.
If the turn comes back to a player who
has already bid, he can increase the
value of his bid or pass.

### Spend

When a player passes, they pick up the
smaller value home card still available
at the center of the table and places it
in his hand. Then they take back half of
the coins they placed in front of them
during bidding (rounded up), the
remaining coins are removed from the
game. A player who passes is no longer
playing for the rest of the round. If you
do not have any more coins, you are
forced to pass.

### End of the round

As soon as all but one players have
passed, the remaining player must
remove all the coins from the game in
front of him and take the last card from
the center of the table.

Then start a new round. The player who
took the biggest card of the previous
round becomes the first player of the
new round.

When all the cards of the house deck
are distributed between the players,
the purchase phase ends. Then go to
the sales phase.

## Phase 2: Sale of houses

During this phase, the players resell the
houses acquired during the first phase
against cheques.

This phase is also made up of several
rounds and ends when all the cheques
have been distributed.

At the beginning of each round, draw as
many cheque cards as players and place
them face up to the center of the
table. The round ends when all these
cheque have been taken by the
players.

The players all play simultaneously:
each chooses a house card from his
hand and the with face hidden in
front of him. When all the players
have chosen their card, they all reveal
it at the same time.

The player who played the highest
value home takes the highest cheque
in the center of the table, the next
one takes the highest remaining
cheque, and so on until all the players
have taken a cheque.

The players keep the cheques they
acquired in front of them, hidden,
face down. The houses played are
removed from the game.

When all the cheques in the center of
the table have been taken, the round
ends. Then start a new round in the
same way.

## End of the game

The game ends when all the players
have sold their homes and therefore
all the cheques have been split
between the players.

Each player then adds the value of all
his cheques and all the coins he has
not spent during the purchase phase.
The richest player is declared the
winner. In the event of a tie, the one
to whom the most coins remain is the
same. If there is still a tie, victory is
shared.
